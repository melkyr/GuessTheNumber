## Welcome to an Evil Aproximation of Guess The Number
Hello this is my version in WPF of the not-so popular game of GuessTheNumber applying some of WPF transitions.

### GuessTheNumber

The repository is composed of bot a UI part and a ClassLibrary contaning the functions to run the game

```markdown
You will have to clone and compile the repository, it was made targeting .NET Core 3.1

```
By now the game is in spanish so feel free to edit the labels and adapt it to your needings
